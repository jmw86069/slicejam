# slicejam 0.0.1.900

## bug fixes

* Modified `slicejam_analysis.Rmd` section
`"Peak to ATAC Promoter Analysis"`
to use `ignore.strand=TRUE` while overlapping ATAC peaks by
`genome_regions`.
* Modified `slicejam_analysis.Rmd` to use `select="all"` when
annotating peaks to nearest gene, which allows peaks to be
annotated to one or more genes that have the same lowest
distance.

## changes to slicejam_analysis.Rmd

* BED files are created for three subsets of peaks:

   * all peaks
   * MGM-filtered peaks
   * MGM-filtered peak hits

# slicejam 0.0.0.900

* Initial package creation.
